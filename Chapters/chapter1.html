        <p> In my younger years, my father and I would spend countless nights gazing into the heavens, naming each and every star set in the dark sky. He would tell me about each one he knew. Each had a name, and certain stars would work together in groups to form a constellation. However, I saw no link between these stars. Each star sat in its place and danced across the sky alone. There were billions, if not trillions of them in that great unknown, and while they all danced across that night sky at the same time, each followed their own routine. <br> <br> </p> <p>
It wasn’t long before I understood what my father meant when he told me the stars were linked. I had searched for something any two stars shared and found nothing. They didn’t have a physical connection, I had been told they were millions of kilometers apart from one another. How could two things so far away be connected at all? From that stars point of view, a trip to its cousin would mean a thousand lifetimes for a human. But, this realization had only allowed me to realize the true nature of the situation. <br> <br> </p> <p>
From my own point of view, the stars were but a centimeter apart in the night’s sky. A distance so small a grain of rice could connect these two bodies. A line between these two stars was now visible to me, and I knew that to either of those two stars, there was a line visible from me to one of them. We were all connected from the other's perspective. At this point, I had begun to realize a new degree of the connections between bodies.
This phenomenon seemed not to exist only for myself and far far away objects, but instead to any imaginable though. I for one had never had the privilege to see a real, live, dinosaur in my lifetime. Each and every stegosaurus and tyrannosaurus died long before humans existed, and any that some human would be able to bring back with a Jurassic Park type of technology has not happened yet. And while I’m so far from the old kings of this planet, from the perspective of the sun, who has now been alive for 5 or so billion years, last I checked, I was born only a blink and an eye after the last dinosaur died.  <br> </p> <p>
<br>
While I had never seen a dinosaur, an outside source was able to draw a link between the dinosaurs and me. I had begun to draw links of my own between people I knew, who did not know each other. In doing so, I ran through another epiphany. There is, in fact, a physical link between bodies. While I couldn’t see one in the night's sky as I watched the stars with my father, there was still a link. The reason I could not see this link, was because I was the link. What had been linking these two stars from the very beginning was my own mind, seeing each exist at the same time. <br> <br> </p> <p>
I know that every person is a link, and these links are powerful. Likewise, it’s provable that I am also the subject of a linking I know nothing about. A linking done by an outside source, potentially one I will never know exists. Even you, the reader, someone I likely will never meet, is linked to me, just from reading this that I have written.
